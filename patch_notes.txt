5.0
	ongoing code

4.0
	project
		rewrote create_tetri and find_tetri so it includes 2 coordinates for each block of each tetri : column and line. supposed to remove the offset problem between tetris and result square, with a more easily sustainable code

3.0
	project
		added DEBUG var
		looks like there is a problem in the positioning mechanics
			block pos stocked in the struct can't be relative to the size of the side of the end map, as it is now. positions are not off, they are offset because map dimensions may change
				have to add another var (or array dimension ?) in struct for column and row number for proper positionning
				have to adapt resolution algorithm accordingly
		prob have to change find_square_size formula, actual one seems off, hard to tell with the deficient output
	test files
		added files file01, file12 and file21

2.0
	makefile
		text colour changed back to white after writing
	project
		added debug for tetri during instanciation
		added function push_up_tetri that pushes them at the top of their own map. have to be used right after instanciation. should integrate this function during the resolution of the algorithm instead ?
	test files
		added file11, variant of the file1 to test whereas the upshifting is properly working
